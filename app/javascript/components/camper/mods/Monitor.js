        I mostly work on laptops, using just the built-in display. But when it
        was clear that I&apos;d be working from home for at least the entire
        summer of 2020, I decided to get a computer monitor for home. While I
        was shopping around, I decided to keep my eye open for one that had HDMI
        inputs and could run off 12VDC (or less). Amazingly, I found exactly
        what I was looking for in{" "}

          this relatively cheap Sceptre 24&quot; monitor

        . The size, inputs, and power requirements mean that I can easily use it
        in the camper as well as on my desk at home.

        And currently, that&apos;s exactly what I do (take it off my desk when
        we go camping). But, for the $100 price tag, I may buy one just for the
        camper.

        The Wolf Pup came with a hanging bracket for a monitor. There&apos;s
        actually one inside over the queen bed, and another outside on the side
        of the camper. We only ever use the inside one. For power, I have a
        cable with the appropriate barrel connecter on one end and a cigarette
        lighter plug on the other, which goes into the power outlet. My phone
        has a USB-C port, to the USB-C-to-HDMI adapter for my laptop works
        perfectly to allow my phone to drive the monitor. This means I can
        download Netflix shows to my phone for viewing on the monitor.

        And sometimes we&apos;ll load up an iPad with shows. And for that, we
