        This is one of my favorite mods. Most of the stuff listed here is pretty
        straight forward &quot;replace this with that&quot;, &quot;just order
        this and bolt it on&quot;, or you can find three YouTube videos showing
        you what to do. Not this one.

        It started out as a place to put shoes. Mostly because the family would
        come in for the night, and everyone would leave their shoes in front of
        the door in case they were needed for a bathroom break while half
        asleep. After tripping over the shoes a few times, I started looking for
        a new place for them. My original thought was to knock out the side
        panel on one of the dining table bench seats and make a cubby under
        there. But we already use that space for other things. Then I realized
        that the storage space under the bed is huge. And while we do store
        things under there (chairs, screen tent, etc), there was still plenty of
        room.

        At this point we&apos;d had the Gray Ghost for just about a year. So, it
        wasn&apos;t brand new, but it's still in pretty nice shape. So, what ever
        modification I did had to look decent. I&apos;m &quot;handy&quot;, but
        not a great woodworker. So I started looking for some existing storage
        unit that was the right size and color for the task... Ikea to the
        rescue!. Ikea has a <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/besta-tv-unit-black-brown-90294512/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dark brown TV stand</a> called the &quot;BESTÃ…&quot;. It
        was exactly the right height and length, and you can choose the shelves,
        and/or drawers to put in it. The dark brown (the same
        &quot;Espresso&quot; dark brown Ikea uses for everything) matched the
        interior of the camper enough so it doesn&apos;t stand out, and almost
        looks original.

        I decided to set it up with one shelf and a short drawer on one side,
        and a deeper drawer on the other. But the internal configuration is easy
        to change (and you buy all those parts separately. The shelf is perfect
        for flip-flops, and sneakers. And so it the short drawer. So far
        we&apos;ve used the deeper one for beverage storage.

        Honestly, the hardest part was finding the right piece of furniture to
        put in there. Once I got it home (and assembled it), the next step was
        to remove the &quot;paneling&quot; on the side of the bed (see the first
        photo, below). This is all attached with little staples, so with the bed
        lifted it was easy enough to push it out from the back. With the
        paneling off, I had to remove a bed frame support in the middle of the
        area I was going to put the storage unit in. I probably could have
        relied on the storage unit carrying the weight (it's pretty solid) but I
        also put new supports in either side of the storage unit.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        With the &quot;framing&quot; in place, I layed the paneling on the
        ground (face down) and put the storage unit (also face down) on top of
        it. I traced the unit onto the back of the paneling and very
        slowly/carefully cut out the hole with a jig saw. Once I was sure the
        cut out would fit around the storage unit, I put the unit in the camper.
        Next I put the paneling in place, dry-fitting it all. A little trimming,
        and a tiny shim under the storage unit, and the fit came out even better
        than I expected. I put a few tiny nails in the paneling to hold it in
        place, then drove a few long screws through the floor of the storage
        unit into the floor. And a few through the bed frame into the top of the
        storage unit. Then a few more nails into the paneling, and... done!
