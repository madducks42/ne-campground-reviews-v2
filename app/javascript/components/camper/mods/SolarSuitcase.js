        As mentioned above, more often than not, we&apos;re at sites without
        power. So, we primarily rely on a few car batteries that we swap in when
        one goes flat. But, we&apos;d rather not swap batteries and realize that
        eventually these will run out. So, we started looking into solar. Like
        many of these technologies that are new to me, I like to try them out a
        bit before committing (a lot of money). So when it came to solar, it was
        clear that a &quot;solar suitcase&quot; (a sizable, but portable solar
        panel setup) was the right first step. So, I studied up, shopped around
        and decided to go with this{" "}

          Renogy 100 watt, two panel solar suitcase
        </a>
        . The nice thing about this setup is that it's all self contained, and
        includes everything you need (the panels, the charge controller, and the
        battery hook-up cable).
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        After buying this setup, I tried it out on a few trips. The panels
        successfully replenished the power we use in 24 hours throughout a
        single sunny day (assuming about 8 hours in direct, bright sun). That
        said, it's tough to keep anything on most campsites in bright sun all
        day. And rarely do we have sunny days every day in a trip. But, we have
        multiple batteries, so it's not a problem. But if we ever try a trip
        longer than 5 or 6 days with no external power along the way, we might
        have a problem.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        This setup is expandable, meaning that I could add another pair of
        panels to this existing controller, doubling the power generation
        capability. As tempting as this is, we haven&apos;t needed it yet, and
        juggling twice as many panels isn&apos;t appealing. So, I&apos;m not
        doing this soon.

        One other tweak I eventually made to this system was to pick up this{" "}

        . The extension cable gave me more range and flexibility on where I
        place the panels. And the connectors let me build a simple adapter to
        allow me to plug this system into the &quot;solar ready&quot; port on
        the camper (a DIY version of{" "}
