        I don&apos;t have a ton of experience towing, so I knew I wanted to make
        it as easy on myself as possible. So I knew that adding a rear view
        camera was going to happen.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        I did a bit of research and found that, like so many things, you can
        find cheap (less expensive) options, and you can pay a fortune. I tend
        to be sort of cheap, figuring that I can hack an &quot;ok&quot; product
        into being a &quot;good&quot; product. Especially electronics.

        For backup/rear-view cameras, there are two main &quot;flavors&quot;:
        wired and wireless. Given the relatively short trailer, and the fact
        that I don&apos;t need <em>perfect</em> video here, I decided to go for
        the easier installation, and chose wireless. After shopping around, I
        landed on{" "}

        . The price was reasonable, and the reviews were good. When the unit
        showed up, quality appeared to be about what I expected. I was pleased
        to see that the camera body was die-cast metal and not plastic that
        would crack in the elements after a few months.

        The display unit simply plugs into the cigarette outlet in your car. You
        could hardwire it, but I stash mine away when I&apos;m not towing, and I
        don&apos;t use the outlet, so hardwiring didn&apos;t make sense for me.
        I originally tried to just set the display on the dash, resting it on
        the &quot;foot&quot; that came with it, but it frequently fell over.
        Again, I didn&apos;t want to attach it to the car, so I found{" "}

          this weighted &quot;friction dash pad&quot;
        </a>{" "}
        and I zip-tied the monitor base to this. Now I can just set the camera
        monitor on my dash and it's completely stable, and easy to move. (See the
        pics below.)
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        The next step in the installation is the camera, itself. There are two
        parts to this: attaching the camera to the camper, and the wiring.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        The camera isn&apos;t too heavy, so I just drilled <em>small</em>
        holes in the back of the camper, filled them with silicone caulk and
        screwed the camera bracket to the wall. I mounted it relatively high on
        the wall for a few reasons. First, I thought the chances of me finding
        something solid (wood) to screw into were better up there. Next, the
        higher up, the better angle I&apos;d have to judge distance for things
        behind the camper. And last, I was hoping that having the antenna poke
        up above the camper would get me a stronger signal, as opposed to having
        to travel through or around the camper.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        For the wiring... I took the easy approach. Some people have written up
        articles about how they drilled into the cabin and found a power source
        in there. Instead, I opted to tap into the power for the running lights
        located right under the camera. I did a little research about the power
        consumption of the camera to ensure I wouldn&apos;t overload anything,
        but in the end I just tried it out, and it worked great.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        Now, when the lights are on, the camera is on. And honestly, this has
        saved me a few times. Sometimes I&apos;ll hook the camper to the tow
        vehicle while prepping to hit the road, but I&apos;ll intentionally not
        connect the trailer wiring plug to the vehicle because I&apos;m still
        running things (the fridge) off AC power. I always remember to
        disconnect the house power from the camper, but I don&apos;t always
        remember to connect the camper wiring to the car. BUT, because the
        camera works off the trailer lights, when I go to turn the camera on
        before driving away, it's very clear that it's not getting power (because
        I haven&apos;t plugged the trailer into the car).
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        Tapping into the power is really easy. Remove the running light,
        identify the + and - wire (mine were marked, but use a tester, if
        needed), splice in the camera wiring. Easy.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        The slightly more challenging part is making sure it's water tight. When
        I removed the running light, I saw that it was sealed to the camper wall
        with some putty. A little research showed that it's a product like{" "}
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070O93HA/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          this.
        </a>{" "}
        And this is what I used to seal it all around the camera power wire.
        Stating the obvious, if you do this, run the wire out of the bottom edge
        of the light to ensure water doesn&apos;t run down the wire into the
        camper (learn about drip loops). So far, no problems.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        All-in-all, the installation went fine. And the camera worked pretty
        well. Occasionally, the video would freeze. Best I could tell this was
        due to interference from other signals (rarely happened on the highway).
        In an attempt to improve this, I made two changes. The first, was I
        upgraded the antenna attached to the monitor. The antenna on the monitor
        and the camera were these little 6&quot; whip antennas. And I replaced
        the camera antenna with{" "}

        </a>{" "}
        I also replaced the monitor antenna with{" "}

          this one.{" "}
        </a>
        The goal here was to get the antenna outside of the car, and a little
        closer to the camera. Two comments about that antenna. It was supposed
        to have magnets on it, but showed up without them. The seller refunded
        my money, and let me keep the product. I had a couple of small, high
        powered magnets laying around and superglued them into the base. I then
        covered the base with duct tape to ensure it didn&apos;t scratch the
        paint on the roof of the car. The antenna upgrades worked well, and the
        signal is really solid now.
