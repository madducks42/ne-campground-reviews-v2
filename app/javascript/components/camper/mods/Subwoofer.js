          weather-proof 12&quot; sub to our deck sound system!

        (And it sounds <em>amazing </em>, btw). Anyway...

      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        So, even after the upgrade of the interior speakers in the Wolf Pup,
        there was still very little low end. Again, we&apos;re <em>not</em>{" "}
        cranking music for the entire campground. But, I like decent sound, even
        at very low volumes. So, I added a small sub to the camper.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        I wanted to keep the install simple, and I didn&apos;t need much power,
        and I certainly didn&apos;t want something that would drain the
        camper&apos;s batteries. So, after a bit of research I decided to go
        with this little{" "}

          8&quot; active sub from Rockville
        </a>
        . The size, cost, and power were perfect for my needs. It also has an
        auto on/off feature which I thought I would use. But, ultimately I
        decided that I wanted to be able to turn the sub off even when listening
        to music (for example, late at night). So I ended up putting in a toggle
        switch to control power to the sub. The switch lights up when the sub is
        on as an extra reminder to turn it off during quiet hours or when not in
        use.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        Installation was pretty easy. I ran power and signal from the back of
        the Furion head unit to the sub, which I located under the bed right by
        the access hatch. Finding a signal for the sub was easy as the head unit
        has an unused subwoofer output. I mounted the sub on a hinged piece of
        wood just inside the exterior access hatch for the under-bed storage.
        The idea is that it's tucked away, pointing into the camper most of the
        time. But if we ever do want to use the sub with the external speakers,
        we can simply open the exterior hatch, and swing the sub into the
        opening.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        I don&apos;t use it as much as I thought I would. Again, we work hard
        not to disturb other campers. But, when I do use it, it makes a world of
        difference in the sound, even at low volumes.
