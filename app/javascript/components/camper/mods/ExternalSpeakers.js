        I&apos;d been wanting to upgrade the external speakers since we got the
        trailer. The sound was soft, and muted, and didn&apos;t sound good at
        low volumes. But, we rarely use those speakers (partly because of the
        sound quality, I&apos;m sure), so it didn&apos;t make sense to spend
        money on the upgrade. Well, when we pulled the camper out of storage this
        spring, one of the outside speakers sound really distorted, and the
        other sounded slightly distorted. A little research turned up that{" "}

        were the original speakers. I found them listed somewhere else for $9
        each, which explains the poor sound and short life. But, more
        importantly, it gave me an excuse to upgrade the external speakers.

        As mentioned above, while I like music when camping, I&apos;m not
        looking to blast it. I&apos;m looking for quality sound at relatively
        low volumes. And, also covered above, we have the sub-woofer for when we
        want high fidelity.

        So, this means I wasn&apos;t looking to spend a lot of money on high-end
        components. Cost, water-resistance, size, and brand name (and some
        experience) led me to choose a pair of{" "}

        . These may look familiar because they&apos;re the 5-1/4-inch version of
        the speakers I put inside. I probably could have gone with the same
        6-1/2-inch version but I was trying to make the swap as easy as
        possible, and those would definitely require me to make a bigger hole in
        the wall. And, since we don&apos;t need it loud, these should do. They
        are the same size as the originals, and will definitely sound better.
        You can see from the pictures below, they weren&apos;t very precise when
        they cut the holes for the original speakers. It looks like they started
        with a (too-small) hole saw, then free-handed a router to make the hole
        bigger. But, you can&apos;t see it with the speakers in place, so I
        guess is doesn&apos;t matter.
