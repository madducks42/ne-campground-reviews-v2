        Maddox and I are both long-time tent campers. But, a while back, I
        realized that more <em>convenience</em> and <em>comfort</em> means we
        can take more trips...
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        I started with a little Aliner hard-sided pop-up. It was just big enough
        for the kid (3 or 4 years old at the time) and myself. The key was that
        I could pack it up in advance...in fact I&apos;d leave most of our gear
        in the camper... come home from work on a Friday, and take off for a
        weekend of camping. It also had a little 3-way fridge (and sink and
        stove), which meant I could also pack the food up the night before. Add
        in a &quot;real&quot; bed, and its clear why we barely used our tent
        after this.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        It was also easily towed by my red Jeep Wrangler (the Rock Lobster),
        another plus...

        As the family grew, in size and number, we found we had 2 adults, a
        rapidly growing tween (with friends), and a big hound. And our desire to
        camp only grew. So around the end of the 2018 camping season, we started
        talking about a new camper. Something a little more modern, and a little
        larger than the tiny 15 year old Aliner. We did some research and
        realized that, while we wanted more space, we also wanted to make sure
        we kept it small enough that it would be under the length restrictions of the state and national parks in our area. We
        thought through how we&apos;d use it, and realized that the kid would soon
        want to bring friends on our trips. So, we needed beds for 4...

        , seen up top.
      </p>
      <h6 className="is-size-6">
        The key features for us in choosing the 16BHS model were:
      </h6>
      <div className="content">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Total length under 20ft (common cut-off length for the parks in our area)
          </li>
          <li>Queen size (almost) bed, enough room for 2 adults</li>
          <li>Bunk beds for the kid and a friend</li>
          <li>Reasonably sized shower</li>
          <li>Good-sized fridge</li>
          <li>Plenty of storage</li>
          <li>
            Towable by a reasonable family vehicle (3,100lbs empty, 3,900lbs full)
          </li>
        </ul>

      <p className="is-size-7">
        We also upgraded and got the &quot;Black Label Edition&quot;. Many of
        the upgrades are cosmetic:
      </p>
      <div className="content">
        <ul>
          <li>Fiberglass body</li>
          <li>Alloy rims</li>
          <li>Frameless windows</li>
          <li>Solid wood cabinet doors</li>
          <li>Nice countertop</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        And I&apos;m not gonna lie, the aesthetic impact of the fiberglass body
        and rimless windows were a pretty big factor in our choice to go with the
        upgrade.

          />
        </a>
      </div>
      <p className="is-size-7">
        But, there were also a few practical upgrades with the Black Label level:
      </p>
      <div className="content">
        <ul>
          <li>Deeper sink with pull out faucet</li>
          <li>Built-in battery disconnect</li>
          <li>Battery Minder (voltage gauge)</li>
          <li>Upgraded mattresses on all the beds</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p className="is-size-7">
        And there were a few features we weren&apos;t/aren&apos;t planning on
        using, but who knows:
      </p>
      <div className="content">
        <ul>
          <li>Microwave</li>
          <li>Air conditioner</li>
          <li>Toilet</li>
          <li>HD TV antenna</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        The microwave and the AC require external electricity. And even when we
        have a site with power, we don&apos;t use them. Maybe if its hot enough
        we&apos;ll use the AC someday... I will say, when I&apos;m working on
        the camper in the driveway on hot days, I&apos;ve been known to put it
        on.
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        And sites we go to (so far) have decent bathroom setups. So, we
        haven&apos;t yet used the toilet in the camper. Why deal with pumping it
        out if you don&apos;t have to?
      </p>
      <p className="is-size-7 mb-4">
        And the OTA TV antenna is also pretty pointless. If we watch something,
        its something streamed or downloaded.
      </p>
