            Rechargeable, dimmable reading light
          </a>{" "}
          - This is perfect when someone in the camper wants a <em>little</em>{" "}
          light so they can see without disturbing others. It's dimmable,
          produces white or orange-ish light (easier on the eyes) and is
          rechargeable via the plentiful USB ports.

            Dimmable, USB-powered reading light
          </a>{" "}
          - This is a fair bit brighter than the other light. The long
          goose-neck makes it great for shared, indirect light over the larger
          bed.

            Ladder
          </a>{" "}
          - Every once in a while you need to get on the roof, or wipe down the
          awning before rolling it up, or... whatever. So I found this little
          ladder, super light, and fits easily into either of the storage bays.

            Fridge thermometer/alarm
          </a>{" "}
          - we run the fridge on propane quite a bit as most sites we visit
          don&apos;t have power. And while we carry spare propane, I&apos;m
          alway nervous that we&apos;ll run out, the fridge will stop working,
          and we won&apos;t notice until it's too late. So I just picked up this
          thermometer with two remote sensors. I&apos;m going to throw one in
          the fridge and one in the freezer, and set the alarms appropriately.
          Helpful tip someone shared, regular AA batteries don&apos;t do well in
          the cold, so I grabbed some

            Macbook charger
          </a>{" "}
          - I&apos;m writing this over the summer of 2020, and I&apos;m working
          100% remotely. So why not do it from the camper?! But to do so, I
          still need my computer. And as we&apos;ve mentioned, we often camp
          without external power. I work on a recent Macbook Pro, which charges
          via USB-C, and I thought any USB-C power source would work, but not
          the case. If there&apos;s not enough power, the laptop won&apos;t even
          try to charge, the charging system is &quot;smart&quot;. So I found this
          charger, and it works well. I did install a 12V power outlet with
          circuit breaker to handle the high power draw. Between this, the solar
          suitcase, and the cell booster, I should be able work from just about
          anywhere.

            Water filter/pitcher
          </a>{" "}
          - This water pitcher makes a big difference when you&apos;re drinking
          water that has been in the holding tank for a few days. With its
          built-in filter, it makes a noticeable difference.

            Coleman screen house
          </a>{" "}
          - The bugs love me. And James. We step out of the car when we get to a
          camp site (often around dusk), and the first thing we have to do is
          apply bug spray, or they chow on us. Interestingly, they don&apos;t
          seem to bother Maddox much (too bitter?). Anyway... in addition to
          being extra-tasty to mosquitos, we also often camp near water. So,
          we&apos;re always prepared with bug spray, <em>and</em> this screen
          tent. We had a cheaper, lighter one, but it required a lot of guy
          lines and still collapsed every time it got a bit windy. Once I
          realized we&apos;d almost always be camping with the camper, I stopped
          worrying about weight, and I found one that was stable, and quick/easy
          to set up. It wasn&apos;t cheap, at almost $200, but its already
          lasted more than twice as long as the previous one (4 seasons), and
          it's still in great shape. It's really easy to set up, <em>except</em>{" "}
          that it's pretty heavy. When it's all packed into its bag, it's just over
          50lbs. This is because of the sturdy metal folding frame. So, I&apos;d
          never use this if I had to carry it very far, but it's perfect to set
          up over a picnic table next to the trailer if we&apos;re expecting
          rain (yes, the roof blocks the rain) or if it's a buggy area.
